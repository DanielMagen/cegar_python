# TODO check if you can maintain table assumption 1

# TODO add to the full explanation the various complexities of various important actions

# TODO create a struct to hold connection data

# TODO read and implement guy's method of converting the given network to have only one output

# TODO the tables starting index takes a lot of resources to maintain. if we call it only rarely it might be preferable
#  to simply remove it and set a method to compute it from scratch each time we need it. check if you really need it.
