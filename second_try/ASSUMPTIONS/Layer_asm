Layer assumptions:
1)
each layer would be segmented into 5 table objects that would represent nodes from all possible kinds
in the following order:
(pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec), (unprocessed)

2)
each layer would contain 2 tables lists
the first table list would be a list of regular nodes tables and the second would be a list of arnode tables.
regular nodes tables would allow deletion only at the lowest table.
arnodes tables would allow deletion at all tables.
