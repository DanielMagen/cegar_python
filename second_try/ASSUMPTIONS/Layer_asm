Layer assumptions:
1)
each layer would be represented by 2 table lists.
the first list would contain only regular nodes. it would contain 5 table objects in the following order:
(pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec), (unprocessed)
such that the first 4 table objects would not support deletion and the 5th would.

the second list would only arnodes. to preserve arnode assumption (2) it would contain 4 table objects
in the following order:
(pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec)

each time a node would be inserted into the (pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec) tables in the regular node
tables list, we will create a arnode which would contain it and insert it to the corresponding table in the
second table list
