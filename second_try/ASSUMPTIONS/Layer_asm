Layer assumptions:
1)
each layer containing the nodes would be segmented into a consecutive ordered list of tables, and the number of such
tables per layer would be known and unchanging by the time this node is created.

2) each layer would contain 2 tables lists
the first table list would be a list of regular nodes tables and the second would be a list of arnode tables.
regular nodes tables would only allow deletion at the lowest table.
arnodes tables would allow deletion at all tables.
