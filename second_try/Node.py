class Node:
    """
    this class would represent a node that would work under the following assumptions:
    1) each layer containing the nodes would be segmented into a consecutive list of tables, and the number of such
    tables per layer would be known and unchanging by the time this node is created.

    2) the node can not be moved to another layer

    3) nodes are not connected to other nodes in the same layer

    4) the tables of each layer would be of 2 kinds:
    a) tables in which nodes can never be deleted from
    b) tables in which nodes can be deleted from

    we will assume that the tables will be ordered such that all tables of type a occur before tables of type b
    (the tables are ordered by assumption (1))

    the node would be told how many tables support deletion in the layers its connected to

    5) nodes that are added to tables of type a will be added at the bottom of the table and
    will never move or be deleted once added. as such for the nodes that reside in those tables,
    the nodes index_in_table would serve as an absolute unchanging id
