    this class would represent a ARNode that would work under the assumptions detailed in

    important note:
    the arnode wraps regular nodes.
    it has 3 possible activation status and depending on each on them it behaves somewhat differently.
    the arnode has been designed and implemented such that
    1) when the arnode takes over a regular node, all of the actions that are supposed to take place on the regular
    node, now take place using this arnode
    2) if an arnode has a neighbor which is a regular node, then some actions of that node can affect the arnode.
    if so, then the arnode takes care to notice those actions. if the arnode does not do anything about some actions,
    then it means that they do not affect the arnode.
