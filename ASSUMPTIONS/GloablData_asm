1)
each node would have a unique set of ids that would not intersect any other nodes id set

2)
Marabou can handle gaps in ids (no sure about that one, but I asked guy)

3)
-> ARNode assumption (8)

4)
-> Layer assumptions (11)

5)
input nodes would never return their global id until the program is finished.
this is very important, because the global data manager relies on it.
because of this assumption the manager can save a copy of the first network data and be sure that
when we tell it that for example variable number 5 is an input node, that its really an input node and the same
one as the one of the current network.
even if the input node is wrapped inside an arnode, from assumption (3) and assumption (4)
we know that the input node id will never be returned.
this is because from assumption (3) we know that an id is returned when the arnode which wraps the node is
fully activated. but from assumption (4) we know that an input arnode would never be fully activated.

6)
-> Layer conclusion (3)
