Layer assumptions:
1)
each layer would be represented by 2 table lists.
the first list would contain only regular nodes. it would contain 5 table objects in the following order:
(pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec), (unprocessed)
such that the first 4 table objects would not support deletion and the 5th would.

the second list would only arnodes. to preserve arnode assumption (2) it would contain 4 table objects
in the following order:
(pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec)

each time a node would be inserted into the (pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec) tables in the regular node
tables list, we will create a arnode which would contain it and insert it to the corresponding table in the
second table list

2) the table number would correspond to the type of nodes it would contain
0 -> (pos,inc)
1 -> (pos,dec)
2 -> (neg,inc)
3 -> (neg,dec)
4 -> (unprocessed)

3)
all the edges would be added to the regular node before splitting it into the various type tables
