Node assumptions:
1)
-> Layer assumptions (1)

2)
the node can not be moved to another layer

3)
nodes are not connected to other nodes in the same layer

4)
the tables of each layer would be of 2 kinds:
a) tables in which nodes can never be deleted from
b) tables in which nodes can be deleted from

we will assume that the tables will be ordered such that all tables of type a occur before tables of type b
(the tables are ordered by assumption (1))

5)
all the nodes outgoing edges connect to nodes which all reside in the same layer
all the nodes incoming edges connect to nodes which all reside in the same layer

6)
-> Layer assumptions (5)

7)
every node created would have a global id, unless its nested inside an arnode that took ownership on all global data.
such ownership is detailed in arnode assumption (8)

8)
each node equation would be determined by its incoming connections only

9)
the node equation and constraint would be set and deleted together. as such to check if a constraint was set before
(in the case that a constraint was needed to be set), we could simply check if an equation was set before

10)
when a node returns a global id, it returns it without any bounds, constraints and equations
i.e. "you got a clean id, you will return a clean id"

11)
inner layers nodes would have 2 global ids, and outer layers nodes would have only 1 global id

12)
only input and output nodes would have a bounds set on them
other nodes would have their bounds calculated by the marabou system
