Node assumptions:
1)
-> Layer assumptions (1)

2)
the node can not be moved to another layer

3)
nodes are not connected to other nodes in the same layer

4)
the tables of each layer would be of 2 kinds:
a) tables in which nodes can never be deleted from
b) tables in which nodes can be deleted from

we will assume that the tables will be ordered such that all tables of type a occur before tables of type b
(the tables are ordered by assumption (1))

5)
all the nodes outgoing edges connect to nodes which all reside in the same layer
all the nodes incoming edges connect to nodes which all reside in the same layer

6)
-> Layer assumptions (5)

7)
the node equation and constraint would be set and deleted together. as such to check if a constraint was set before
(in the case that a constraint was needed to be set), we could simply check if an equation was set before

8)
each node equation would be determined by its incoming connections only
