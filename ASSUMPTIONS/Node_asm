Node assumptions:
1)
-> Layer assumptions (1)

2)
the node can not be moved to another layer

3)
nodes are not connected to other nodes in the same layer

4)
the tables of each layer would be of 2 kinds:
a) tables in which nodes can never be deleted from
b) tables in which nodes can be deleted from

we will assume that the tables will be ordered such that all tables of type a occur before tables of type b
(the tables are ordered by assumption (1))

the node would be told how many tables support deletion in the layers its connected to

5)
all the nodes outgoing edges connect to nodes which all reside in the same layer
all the nodes incoming edges connect to nodes which all reside in the same layer
