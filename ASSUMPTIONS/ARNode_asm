ARNode assumptions:
1)
ARNodes are only connected to other ARNode

2)
ARNodes would contain only nodes from the same table, which are set in stone and have
the nodes that are connected to them set in stone

3)
ARNodes can merge with other ARNode, split and change location

4)
ARNodes would not split or merge unless they are fully activated

5) nodes have only three activation status: activated, forward (partially) activated, fully activated

forward activated entails that
a) all the arnodes which this arnode should be connected to via an outgoing connection have been created

fully activated entails that
a) the arnodes that have outgoing connections (which are incoming) to this node must be forward activated
b) the arnodes that we are connected to by outgoing connections will be fully activated
