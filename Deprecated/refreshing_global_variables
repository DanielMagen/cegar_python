2 reasons why I removed this capability
1) no usage for it
2) as it currently, there is an infinite loop if we are trying to refresh the global data of a node which is
nested inside an arnode which is not fully activated


function inside the layer class:

        equation and constraints calculated after the refresh has finished.
        refresh all the nodes and arnodes in the layer.

        from assumption (7) this method assumes that all nodes that should have a global id,
        really do have a global id.

        of course, it does not refresh nodes which are nested inside a fully activated arnode, all nodes which should
        have a global id

        otherwise, if the node has no global data and is nested inside an arnode this method does nothing
        and returns a reference to the arnode the node is nested in. this is because this method assumes that
        if such a case is met then we are fulfilling arnode assumption (8), i.e. this node has given up any
        authority to decide what the global variables are and the decision is entirely up to the arnode its nested in.

        otherwise, after the method is over it returns Node.NO_REFERENCE

        outgoing connection, and tells it that its global data is not valid
        (we changed our id so the node which is outgoing from us has an invalid equation).
        as such when calling this function, to avoid inefficiency, if you need to also refresh nodes which we are
        connected to by an outgoing connection, its better to refresh us first, because else you will need to
