Those are the table classes before the removal of assumption (2) which forced the tables to have a starting index.
assumption (2) was that each table would contain the index in the layer of its starting node.
it was deprecated because the whole purpose of this assumption was for us to calculate where each node is
in relation to its layer, but there is no need for a node to know its position in the layer.

I hold the classes in txt form so that pycharm won't recognize the classes as valid.
