"""
the idea is to support a plethora of actions in a single united data structure
and to allow outer algorithms to determine which operations to take and in what order.
in other words, separate between the implementation and decisions making.


each network would be represented by both a real live network that can be used for computation and experiments,
and the inner representation which we would implement here

each network inner representation would be implemented as such:
1 - overall we would have a vector of layers
2 - in each layer we would have a vector of 5 "table objects" that would represent
nodes from all possible kinds in the following order:
(pos,inc), (pos,dec), (neg,inc), (neg,dec), (unprocessed)

each table object would contain the nodes in the network in a corresponding order to the one in the network.
also each table would contain the index in the layer of its starting node.
the tables in the same layer would be connected by their index values
such that changing the amount of nodes in a table would change the starting index of all the tables below it.

each node object would contain

- location_data of the form:
[the layer its in, the table its in in the layer (its classification), its index in the table]
(if the node is an inner node nested inside a merged node, its index in the table is irrelevant)

- a list of nodes that are connected to it(maybe have this list correspond to the 5 table structure of the previous
layer so for example we could say that we are connected to 5'th node in the 3rd table of the previous layer. this would
also allow better merging capabilities later on)

- a list of nodes it is connected to (again have this correspond to the 5 table structure of the next layer)

- a weight per edge

- a list of inner nodes : each with their own parameters

- the needed functions to calculate the relations between its inner nodes parameters and its parameters


TODO write down the list of assumptions that you have so that it would be easier to debug later
