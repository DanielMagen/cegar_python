the idea is such:
if we want to verify that y > c we would search for an input which gives us y <= c
i.e. that N(x)=y <= c
so we will create N' such that N(x) <= N'(x)
and as such N'(x) <= c --> N(x) <= c

so if we want to verify that y > c we will enlarge the output of the network
and if we want to verify that y < c we will dwindle the output of the network
